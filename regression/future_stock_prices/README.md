# Regression Algorithm (Prediction)

Predicts the price of Google's stock 30 days into the future.

## Notes
_Uses stock prices from Quandl._

_Since the data was already shown to the model, this essentially does not predict much, rather its a simulation of sorts._

_This project was developed by following a Tutorial from Sentdex in order to get acclimated to Machine Learning_
